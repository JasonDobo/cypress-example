# cypress-example
This is a simple cypress example project to verify project setup

# Initial setup 
This section detials how I setup cypress for the project, but this is not needed if you pull the code from github. It is simple included for reference.
- I used homebrew to install node, using the command "brew install node"
-- npm version "v19.2.0" and npm version "8.19.3"

- npm install cypress --save-dev
-- This will insatll cypress to the project under the "node_modules" folder and create a "package.json" The version which was install was "12.0.2"




## Installed nodes
For reference, here is a list of installed node, though `npm install` should be sufficient to install all dependencies

- npm install cypress -save-dev
- npm install -D @badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor
- npm install -D @bahmutov/cypress-esbuild-preprocessor
